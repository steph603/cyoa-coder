        'The girl thought about what made her fall in love with the veterinary
        industry. She had been inspired by her amazing teachers when studying to
        become a veterinary nurse. She would love to pass on her knowledge and
        passion to other nurses and inspire them to do amazing things too. She
        studied to become a teacher, and landed a job with a team of some of the
        best vet nurses in the country.Together, they helped train hundreds of
        new veterinary nurses to go into the world and follow their own dreams.
        The girl was happy. Her job was fulfilling, she had more time for her
        friends and for the circus. She got stronger and fitter and was able to
        perform in some shows! Unfortunately, one day, her wonderful team began
        to fall apart. The team\'s manager left, and was replaced with someone
        who didn\â€™t share their same passion. Her team began to move away onto
        other things- moved to other cities, moved to other jobs, or left to
        raise their families. She was no longer having any fun...',
