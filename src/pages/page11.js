        The girl stumbled upon a one-year contract with a company that supplies
        pathology equipment to veterinary hospitals.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>She jokingly called the machines ’blood sucking robots’.</p>{" "}
      <p>
        These very cool machines help veterinarians diagnose pets through
        biochemistry, haematology and other tests on the spot instead of waiting
        for days for results to come back from the laboratory.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        She had always enjoyed using and maintaining these machines in
        veterinary hospitals, so working in a lab sounded like it might be fun,
        and she jokingly called the machines <i>'blood sucking robots'</i>{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        In her new role, she learned how to take the machines apart, repair them
        and troubleshoot what might be going wrong when a veterinarian receives
        unexpected results.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        She was using two very different skillsets – her love for technology and
        breaking things apart to fix them again, as well as her knowledge of
        veterinary medicine and workflows to piece together some unique puzzles.{" "}
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <p>
        When her year contract was up, the company told the girl that if she
        wanted to stay, she would have to work overnight shifts, as well as give
        up her weekends again…
      </p>{" "}
      <p>The girl sighed…</p>
