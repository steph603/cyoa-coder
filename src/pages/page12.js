        'In a stroke of excellent timing, a friend asked the girl if she was
        interested in working with her favourite pet nutrition company… One of
        the best pet foods in the world! She was excited! It was a new
        challenge. The girl had never worked in a sales role before, and it
        didn\’t feel quite right to her. She was able to pick up some other
        duties – teaching others about pet nutrition and managing a team, which
        she enjoyed much more. The girl felt like she was very lucky. She was
        travelling the world and she was seeing happy, healthy pets loving their
        food and thriving because of their great diets! Her working hours were
        alright, and she was being rewarded well for her efforts, but the girl
        just wasn\’t quite happy, she didn\’t feel like she was doing \’good\’
        for the world….',
