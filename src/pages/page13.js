        Just when the girl felt like she had explored all the possibilities of
        her life in the veterinary industry–</p>
        <p>She’d lived her dream as a veterinary nurse, 
        <p> she had taught a new generation of vet nurses, </p> 
        <p> she had played with some really cool robots,</p>
        <p>and she had tried her hand at sales.... </p>
        <br /> 

         <p>A new virus took hold of the world...
         Everyone was stuck at home, and
        the girl had a LOT of time to think about her options. </p>
        <p> She thought about what she was good at.</p>
       <p> And she thought about what she'd always wanted to do
        if anything were possible. </p> 

        <p>She thought about the teacher that told her she could never code because she was “just a girl”, and
        now she KNEW that it was time to prove him wrong... </p>
