        The girl spent her time stuck at home reigniting her love for coding.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        She had visited the idea of coding a few times before but never had the
        time to get any good. She was now learning some skills she’d always
        wanted to learn and seeing all the possibilities for her future open up
        again.
      </p>
      <p>She thought about all of the things she might make… </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Perhaps she could work on a practice management system that would help
        veterinarians better manage their days! One that allows them to move to
        a paperless system, and improve patient care by eliminating
        miscommunication?
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Or create a learning platform that better engages students and presents
        learning materials in a fun and mobile format?
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe she could teach robots new algorithms to help them measure blood
        samples and give even better results?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or create beautiful websites that help consumers make the best decisions
        and give them access to products their pets will love?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        She knew that this was really just the beginning of her options, and
        there were a million other things that she could end up doing with her
        new skills, and that they all sounded exciting.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Whatever it was that she found herself doing in the future, the girl
        knew that she would never tell another girl{" "}
        <i>“you can’t do it, you’re just a girl”.</i>{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
      The girl did some research. She found a college that she knew would give
      her the best chance at excelling in her new chosen career, and she (with a
      few nerves…!) wholeheartedly looked forward to her next chapter.
