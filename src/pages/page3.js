        One day, the girl spoke with her computer teacher about her options. </p>
        <i>“You could be so great if you wanted to study computer science, but you
        can’t.  You’re just a girl.”</i>
        <p> The stubborn girl was a bit mad at this
        comment. Part of her wanted to do it anyway just to prove the teacher
        wrong, but instead she took it to heart and was worried that maybe she
        would never get a job… </p>
