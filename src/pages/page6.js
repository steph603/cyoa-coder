        The girl loved veterinary nursing! </p>
        <p>
         She was very good at it! </p>
        <p> She had some
        wonderful teachers, and later on, some wonderful colleagues that would
        be lifelong friends.</p>
        <p>She loved saving lives, and she loved helping
        others improve the lives and the health of their pets. </p> 
        <p>Throughout her
        career she was lucky enough to be part of important stories â€“ brand new
        puppies and kittens that visit the clinic, growing up through the years
        to be senior pets and important parts of their families.
