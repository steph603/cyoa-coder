        Some years later, the girl fell in love with the circus.</p>
        
        <p>She didnâ€™t
        realise that this was a hobby that mere mortals could enjoy! </p>
        <p> She knew
        she would probably never run away with the circus, but it became an
        important part of her life and she wanted to become stronger and more
        graceful so she could perform her art for others to enjoy. </p>
        <p> Whenever she could, the girl travelled to
        circus festivals at home and overseas and trained with her friends and
        professional artists. </p>
